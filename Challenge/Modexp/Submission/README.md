# MODEXP Yukon submission

This directory is the complete editable surface for the `modexp` track. A
submission must include:

- `bytecode.hex`: one line of lowercase EVM bytecode without a `0x` prefix;
- `Solution.lean`: `Challenge.Modexp.Benchmark.candidate`, proving
  `Challenge.Modexp.Correct bytecode` for the generated artifact.

Additional Lean modules may live here and be imported by `Solution.lean`.
Everything outside this directory is the protected specification, proof
support, evaluator, and workflow.

The lower-is-better score is gas summed over the public vectors.
Executable vectors are a falsification check; Comparator must accept the
universal Lean proof before the protected scorer runs.
